Title : heart cinnamon rolls
Recipe : 
1. Ingredients : 1. 3 Tablespoons melted butter, separated. 2. Sugar 3. Brown sugar 4. Cinnamon 5. Store bought pizza dough (The Cheat) 6. Baking sheet 7. Thread (I used quilting thread. Fishing line will work also. This is used to cut the rolls) 8. Orange juice 9. Pastry brush 10. Small bowls
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
3. Roll out the dough. 
4. Using the pastry brush brush 2 tablespoons of the melted butter over the top of the dough. 
5. Next, sprinkle a layer of sugar followed by a layer of cinnamon, and finally brown sugar. 
6. You can use any amount you want of these. 
7. Keep in mind that the more you use, the more of a mess you'll have when rolling them up and baking them. 
8. The less you have, the more likely they will keep their shape better.
9. Finish up by dribbling the last tablespoon of melted butter over the top
10. Beginning with the edge nearest you, start rolling the dough up. 
11. When you get halfway done, stop. 
12. Now start rolling the dough from the far edge till it meets the first rolled up part.
13. Snip a good length of thread. 
14. Place the middle of the thread under the rolled up dough. 
15. Place it in as far as the size of the roll you want. 
16. Pull the end of the thread up and cross the two sides. 
17. As you pull the sides in opposite directions the thread will cut the dough. I always use this method when cutting dough. Whenever I try using a knife, it makes a mess. 
18. Using thread makes a very clean cut. 
19. Place the uncooked cinnamon rolls on a greased baking sheet. 
20. Pinch the bottom of the rolls to make the heart shape. 
21. Bake for 10 minutes.
22. Orange glaze (Optional): In a small bowl place roughly 1 tablespoon to 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar. 
23. Mix in 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon of orange juice. 
24. You don't want the glaze to be too watery, but you don't want it to be thick. 
25. Spoon over the rolls when they come out of the oven. 
26. Let the cinnamon rolls cool a bit and enjoy!""",

            "expected_output": """Question: Why should the pastry brush be used to brush melted butter over the top of the dough?
Answer: The pastry brush should be used to brush melted butter over the top of the dough because it helps to evenly distribute the butter over the surface of the dough, ensuring that the sugar and cinnamon layers are well coated.
Reasoning: The melted butter provides a moist surface that helps the sugar and cinnamon to adhere to the dough, resulting in a sweet and flavorful cinnamon roll. Brushing the melted butter evenly ensures that the sugar and cinnamon are well incorporated into the roll.

Question: What is the purpose of pinching the bottom of the rolls to make the heart shape?
Answer: The purpose of pinching the bottom of the rolls to make the heart shape is to give the cinnamon rolls a distinctive and attractive appearance.
Reasoning: By pinching the bottom of the rolls into a heart shape, the recipe creator adds a touch of creativity and personalization to the cinnamon rolls, making them more visually appealing.

Question: Why is it important to work with well-chilled pastry when rolling dough?
Answer: It is important to work with well-chilled pastry when rolling dough because otherwise, the dough will stick to the counter and tear, making it difficult to roll out evenly.
Reasoning: Well-chilled pastry is less likely to stick to the counter and easier to handle, leading to a more successful and efficient rolling process. When the dough is too warm, it becomes more pliable and can easily be torn or stretched, which can affect the texture and final appearance of the finished product.

Question: How much sugar and cinnamon should be used when making heart cinnamon rolls?
Answer: The amount of sugar and cinnamon used when making heart cinnamon rolls is a matter of personal preference.
Reasoning: The recipe states that the amount of sugar and cinnamon used can be adjusted to taste, but notes that the more that is used, the more messy the rolls will be when rolled up and baked. Using less sugar and cinnamon may result in a more uniform and visually appealing finished product."""

title : venison suasages
Recipe :
Ingredients : "Without going into to much detail, the first step is obviously to get yourself a source of venison. This is a Samba deer that I shot recently and with much respect and without wasting any venison, the meat was harvested from the animal. Leaving the meat to hang in the coolroom for 5 days allows the blood to drain.",
1. The first step in any cooking effort is obviously to gather all the necessary ingredients. With venison sausage making, it is important that you mix fat through the concoction as venison is a very lean meat that when is cooked becomes very dry, so, rule of thumb is to add of 30% pork fat and 70% venison accompanied with 1 cup of iced water. When adding flavours to the sausages choose spices and herbs that you enjoy, for instance, I added curry in one batch, and chilli in another. Now the main ingredient, the skins, personally I use natural skins as they seem to not burst as easy in the filling stage, and when being cooked. however, the only down side being the varying circumference of the intestine that creates fatter sausages, any local butcher would sell sheep intestines (which is the snag casings). You will also need mixing bowls, a meat mincer with the sausage filling attachment and a lot of time.
2. Alright, now that you have all the ingredients it is time to start. first you need to run the venison through the mincer, I like to use a medium sized mince, which is around 4mm. After you have minced the venison now mince the pork fat.
3. As listed earlier you should pick flavours that you enjoy, firstly you must mix 30% pork fat mince with 70% venison mince along with the flavours you wish to add and 1 cup of iced water  different flavours such as curry and chilli do not require much of as they are strong, so in terms of quantitys it is hard to guess, however, there is a small trick I like to use, after you have mixed your minces and flavours you can take a small scoop of mixture and cook it and sample to see if it needs more flavour or more mince to tone the strength of the flavours down.
4. the final step is to put the Mince in the case, and to do this you first must put the sausage attatchment onto your mincer, while you are doing this soak your natural skins in water as they are preserved in salt you want to get all this salt out of the skins. Now cut a length of skin around 1 meter, and slide it onto the sausage filler until you have 2 inches hanging off the nozel, now tie a knot in the end of the skin and slide the rest on, now add your mixture into the chamber of the mincer and on the surrounding tray, turn the mincer on and very steadily (not to fast) stuff the Mince down the shoot so that it fills the skins, with one person doing that the other must support the sausage and slowly aid it in filling by moving away from the mincer. After you have filled about 95cm of your 1m skin stop filling and again tie a knot in the end, to make sausage length sausages you can first pinch and then twist the pinched area to form a perfect snag! let the suasgaes sit over night in the fridge.
5. When cooking theses sausages venison takes a while longer to cook than your standard snags, depending on sausage width sometimes it is good to bbq the snag and then chuck it in the oven to cook it right through.

```Recipe : how to make latin seasoned breaded fried chicken breast 
Ingredients:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1.5 - 2 lbs)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup breadcrumbs (preferably Panko, for extra crunch)
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped (optional)
- Vegetable oil or canola oil, for frying
- Lime wedges, for serving (optional)
Instructions:
1. Prepare the chicken: Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. If they are thick, you may want to butterfly them or pound them to a uniform thickness (about 1/2-inch) to ensure even cooking.
2. Set up the breading station: In a shallow dish, mix the flour with 1/2 tsp salt. In another shallow dish, beat the eggs. In a third shallow dish, combine the breadcrumbs, smoked paprika, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper (if using), black pepper, and 1 tsp salt. Stir in the chopped cilantro, if using.
3. Bread the chicken: Coat each chicken breast in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Then, dip it into the beaten eggs, letting any excess drip off. Finally, press the chicken breast into the breadcrumb mixture, ensuring it's evenly coated on all sides. Set aside on a plate and repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.
4. Heat the oil: In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or frying pan, heat about 1/2 inch of oil over medium-high heat until it reaches approximately 350°F (180°C). You can test the oil temperature by dropping a small pinch of breadcrumbs into the oil; if it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready.
5. Fry the chicken: Carefully place the breaded chicken breasts into the hot oil, being sure not to overcrowd the pan. You may need to fry the chicken in batches. Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the breading is golden brown and the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165°F or 74°C). Use tongs or a slotted spoon to carefully remove the chicken from the oil and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.
6. Serve: Allow the fried chicken to rest for a few minutes before serving. Serve with lime wedges on the side, if desired, for a burst of citrus flavor. Enjoy your Latin Seasoned Breaded Fried Chicken Breast with your favorite side dishes or in a sandwich.```
